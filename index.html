    <h2>My Goal</h2>
        <p>I set a goal - to become an IT developer in a year. 
            Three months ago, I began to study independently on the Frontend developer. 
            In addition to training, I have a non-IT job. I organize my time to have time to learn. 
            I believe that the future is for IT. 
            I like new technologies and I am constantly learning something new.
