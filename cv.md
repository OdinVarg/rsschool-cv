## My Goal

I set a goal - to become an IT developer in a year. Three months ago, I began to study independently on the Frontend developer. In addition to training, I have a non-IT job. I organize my time to have time to learn. I believe that the future is for IT. I like new technologies and I am constantly learning something new.
